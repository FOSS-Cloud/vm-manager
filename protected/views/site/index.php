<p>The FOSS-Cloud is the foundation to build Windows or Linux based SaaS-, Terminal Server-, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) or virtual Server-Environments.</p>
<p>The FOSS-Cloud solution is the most advanced Open Source Cloud in the marketplace today. </p>
<p>Before using, the FOSS-Cloud team would like to remind you that the primary means of sustaining the development of FOSS-Cloud is via contributions by users such as yourself. FOSS-Cloud is now and will continue to be totally free of charge; however, it takes money and resources to make FOSS-Cloud available. If you are able, please consider donating to the FOSS-Cloud Project.</p>
